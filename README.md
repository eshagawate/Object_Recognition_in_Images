# Object_Recognition_in_Images

The repository provides scripts and notebooks for training a CNN-based model for object recognition. 

The model architecture, data preprocessing, training process, and evaluation metrics are included.

### Contents:

-> object_recog_CNN.ipynb : Python script for training the CNN model and the script to evaluate the trained CNN model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.


-> model.h5 : Saved model file for the trained CNN model.

-> test_image.jpg : This image can be used as a check image. 

# Object Recognition using MobileNet

Utilizing MobileNet, a lightweight convolutional neural network architecture, this repository also includes implementations for object recognition. 

Transfer learning using the pre-trained MobileNet model is demonstrated for improved object recognition performance.

### Contents:

-> object_recog_MobileNet.ipynb : Python script demonstrating transfer learning with MobileNet for object recognition for Real-time scenario implementation for object recognition using MobileNet on a live camera feed.

-> Mobile_Net_Object_Detection.png : This is just a reference of the window for object detection using Transfer Learning.
